OXID Attribute Filter Extension 
===============================

OXID eShop: With OXID standard attribute filters, if a customer has selected a filter value,
all other values are hidden in the select-box. When this module is active, all possible
values are selectable. Installation: copy the content of the "copy_this" folder to the 
root of your OXID shop and activate in backend.

Suitable for OXID Version 4.8 (other versions not tested)
